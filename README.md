# Option Pricing & Hedging Engine (C++/Python) üìà

A high-performance quantitative finance library for option pricing, risk analysis (Greeks), and backtesting of a delta-hedging strategy. The core engine is built in C++ for speed, with a Python interface for flexible analysis and deployment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Model Pricing:** Implements Black-Scholes, Binomial Trees (CRR), and Monte Carlo models for European call options.
* **Comprehensive Risk Analysis:** Calculates and validates key Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta) to manage portfolio risk.
* **Rigorous Model Validation:** Provides in-depth analysis of model performance, including error distribution by maturity and sanity checks on Greeks.
* **Delta-Hedging Backtesting Engine:** Simulates a delta-neutral strategy, tracking daily P&L, NAV, transaction costs, and key performance metrics.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A Streamlit web application to visualize model performance, portfolio evolution, and hedging results.
* **Automated Reporting:** Generates analysis reports via the OpenAI (GPT-4) API.
