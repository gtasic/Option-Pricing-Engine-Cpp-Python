## ✨ Key Features

* **Multi-Model Pricing:** Implements Black-Scholes, Binomial Trees (CRR), and Monte Carlo models for European call options.
* **Comprehensive Risk Analysis:** Calculates and validates key Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta) to manage portfolio risk.
* **Rigorous Model Validation:** Provides in-depth analysis of model performance, including error distribution by maturity and sanity checks on Greeks.
* **Delta-Hedging Backtesting Engine:** Simulates a delta-neutral strategy, tracking daily P&L, NAV, transaction costs, and key performance metrics.
* **Volatility Arbitrage:** Volatility Studying through several models to build the vol smile.
* **ML utilization:** Volatility prediction through python ML library and training via real data from yahoo finance.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A Streamlit web application to visualize model performance, portfolio evolution, and hedging results.
* **Automated Reporting:** Generates analysis reports via the OpenAI (GPT-4) API.
